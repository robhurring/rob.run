# Personal curl proxy

Just a simple proxy to some shell scripts that do things I need to do in remote
places. A bit easier than remembering github URLs.

## Pocketvim

[Pocketvim](https://github.com/robhurring/dotvim) is my lightweight, somewhat cozy vim setup. It is meant for temporary
editing sessions on servers.

#### Install

1. `curl -L rob.run/vim`
